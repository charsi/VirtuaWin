Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
VirtuaWin is a small, fast and easy to use virtual desktop manager for
Windows 8. The current desktop is indicated by a small icon in the
system tray to conserve space. There are many configuration possibilities
for both mouse and keyboard control. VirtuaWin also supports modules for
adding features without decreasing the performance in VirtuaWin itself.

Code comments
--------------------------------------------------------------
The source has been compiled using the MINGW & Cygwin gcc compiler as well as
Microsoft MSVC v6.0. It should be possible to compile with other win32 C
compilers with perhaps minor changes.

Check our website for info on module development.
